# Elab_Auto_Print
Python Script to Auto Print Reports
(It works with OS 3rd Year KTR, for other labs, edit the urls in the headers, and you will be good to go)

## * Disclaimer *
This piece of softare does not facilitate cheating in any way. It logs in using the offical credentials and downloads the reports.
If a question is incomplete then the report that is downloaded is empty. This does not exploit any vulnerability in SRM ELAB, it only automates the process of dowloading the reports.

## Pre-Requisites 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```
$ python elab_os_3rd_year.py -u [username] -p [password]
```
